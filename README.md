## Description
This library is created to test different algorithms for conversion between different color models, mainly RGB, HSL and HSV. Its intended use are embedded projects using RGB LEDs.

I am no expert neither in programming or color spaces so bare in mind that my code might be erroneous/buggy. In case you see something wrong let me know using GitHub Discussions or create pull request with fix.
